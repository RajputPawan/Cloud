Define Infra state e.g. Ec2, 
Ansible, puppet or chef automates mostly OS related task.

Terraform works with automation s/w like ansible, after infra setup and ready.
No programming ,it has it's own syntax similar to JSON.(DSL)
Domain specific language(DSL).

 Features of Terraform.

Infrastructure as Code
o Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax
o Provides single unified syntax

Execution Plans
o Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an execution plan
o The execution plan shows what Terraform will do before making the actual changes

Resource Graph
o Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of
any non-dependent resources
Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible

Change Automation
Complex change sets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction
With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what
